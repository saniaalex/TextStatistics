FUTURE WORK:
My team consists of 4 members. We plan on making a dedicated web service for text which can perform following operations-
1. Give statistic of text as done in this segment by me.
2. Give number of occurences of any word in the inputted text.
3. Encrypt the text with a key using AES Encryption.
4. Decryping text using AES Decryption.

We plan on combining all the above services into a single web service.
